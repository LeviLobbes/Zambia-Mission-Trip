                <p>Our day started out as a continuation of the day before… soaring over the ocean sky’s. After 40 long but fulfilling hours full of team bonding, Arabic redbull, and endless search for Dubai chocolate, we finally landed in Zambia. Pretty soon we fell in love with the incredible breezy weather (almost islandic) and we celebrated our triumphant understanding of Kwacha/Zambian currency.</p>
                <p>We then loaded our own version of a party bus and saw our first glimpse of Zambian life. We were amazed by the lively pedestrian traffic and the curious switch of driving norms: driving on the left side while sitting on the right. We were then greeted by our beautifully unique and culturally attractive hotel, with palm trees and a pool straight of our paradise. After settling into our rooms and FINALLY changing clothes and feeling like real humans again, we joined Family Legacy staff for an incredible and instructive lunch where we heard about Child Protection and Safe Guarding Policy. We were then able to put our new knowledge to the test when we arrived at one of Family’s Legacy’s main Zambian school. We were greeted by enthusiastic students and teachers who jumped and clapped at our arrival, making us feel so welcomed. We got to interact with these students and learn about their dreams. One of the girls I met, Kayla, showed me a dress she was making for her younger sister and told me she dreamed of being an accountant. These students were preparing to take final exams next week, and it was beautiful to be able to encourage them and meet them. After interacting with Family Legacy’s students one on one, we had the opportunity to step into their lives in the local villages. Walking through the streets gave us a mind blowing perspective on the height of their joy despite the dept of their poverty. Wherever we turned, not a penny was asked of us. Instead, we were greeted with broad and gleaming smiles. Walking hand in hand with toddlers living with next to nothing left us with a lingering sense of what David must have felt when he asked, “Lord, why me?” As we’re all heading to bed early due to an unimaginable jet lag- we are humbled and reminded of the Lord’s faithfulness in every situation, and the unfailing joy of his presence in all places. We can’t contain our excitement over the coming days, and are beyond thankful for everyone who made this happen. Keep following along!!</p>
