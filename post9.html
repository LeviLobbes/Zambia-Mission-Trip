                <p>Early in the morning, we headed down to the river boats and began our journey across the river to the safari grounds. We watched a beautiful sunrise on the water. When we arrived at the grounds, there were three safari vehicles waiting for us to fill them. Shortly after our departure, we stopped for breakfast right on the edge of the park, overlooking the water. After breakfast our wonderful guides drove us around showing us elephants, baboons, water buffalo, and many other animals. We then met again for lunch, where we all sat in a circle and shared stories and memories from our trip.</p>
                <p>The day gave us a beautiful image of God's creation, and we were in awe from beginning to end. We headed back to where we were staying and enjoyed one last meal together as a team. Our experience was absolutely incredible.</p>
