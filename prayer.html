            <h3>Unity for Our Team</h3>
            <p class="meta">Posted on July 23, 2025</p>
            <p>Please pray that as a team we will work together as one, that we will be servant hearted, patient, and loving with each other, even on days that are long and exhausting! 
                
                "May the God who gives endurance and encouragement give you the same attitude of mind toward each other that Christ Jesus had, so that with one mind and one voice you may glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. Accept one another, then, just as Christ accepted you, in order to bring praise to God." Romans 15:5-7 NIV</p>

            <h3>Open Hearts</h3>
            <p class="meta">Posted on July 23, 2025</p>
            <p>Please pray that our hearts will be soft and open to our Zambian friends and their incredible country. And let's pray the Lord will be daily opening our hearts and minds to what He would teach us during this time. 
                
                "Yet you, Lord, are our Father. We are the clay, you are the potter; we are all the work of your hand." Isaiah 64:8 NIV</p>

            <h3>Zambian Students</h3>
            <p class="meta">Posted on July 25, 2025</p>
            <p>Please pray that the Zambian Students' hearts and minds are ready to receive and to be encouraged. Please pray that they will be able to attend each session and be engaged in the learning process. Pray that they will gather useful information and skills that will be essential in their job search. Let's also pray that they will come to know the Father's love for them in a deeper way. 

                "For this reason, ever since I heard about your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for all God's people, I have not stopped giving thanks for you, remembering you in my prayers. I keep asking that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the glorious Father, may give you the Spirit of wisdom and revelation, so that you may know Him better. I pray that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened in order that you may know the hope to which He has called you, the riches of His glorious inheritance in His holy people." Ephesians 1:15-18
