            <h3>Unity for Our Team</h3>
            <p class="meta">Posted on July 23, 2025</p>
            <p>Please pray that as a team we will work together as one, that we will be servant hearted, patient, and loving with each other, even on days that are long and exhausting! 
                
                "May the God who gives endurance and encouragement give you the same attitude of mind toward each other that Christ Jesus had, so that with one mind and one voice you may glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. Accept one another, then, just as Christ accepted you, in order to bring praise to God." Romans 15:5-7 NIV</p>

            <h3>Open Hearts</h3>
            <p class="meta">Posted on July 23, 2025</p>
            <p>Please pray that our hearts will be soft and open to our Zambian friends and their incredible country. And let's pray the Lord will be daily opening our hearts and minds to what He would teach us during this time. 
                
                "Yet you, Lord, are our Father. We are the clay, you are the potter; we are all the work of your hand." Isaiah 64:8 NIV</p>
