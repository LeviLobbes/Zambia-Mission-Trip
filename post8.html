                <p>Wow! What a life changing day today was for so many! It was truly a joy to get to watch students that we have spent the whole week with grow and show off all of their skills today. It was so fun to run to our students after they interviewed to ask how it went and see how they were feeling. Although the day didn’t go completely as planned, lives were truly changed. We think that around 20-25% of our students will have jobs from all of their hard work and dedication this week. Seeing the joy on their faces after getting the news that they either got the job, a second interview, or even just a referral was unforgettable for each of us. We are praying that as these students go into their next chapter of life, they continue to not only grow in their business skills they might have learned this week, but most importantly their love for the Father. It was amazing to see how the Lord was moving in their lives as well as ours.</p>
                <p>We all celebrated together with a local ice cream truck that came to the conference center. It was a great way to close out our time with our students. We are so proud of all their hard work and accomplishments!</p>
                <p>After a rewarding day, we got to spend one last dinner together at Legacy Lodge before we head out to our safari tomorrow. It’s always great to recharge from the day surrounded by the most amazing group of new friends. Enjoying fellowship around a fire, we had delicious s’mores to round out dinner.</p>
                <p>For devotional this evening, we planned on going around in a circle for about 20 minutes giving each teammate compliments on the wonderful qualities we have all witnessed in them this week. However we quickly realized that our team is so amazing that we ended up speaking on each other’s character for nearly two hours. We are so blessed to have such a supportive group of individuals who have truly come together as one on this trip. We are so excited to see the way these friendships continue to grow as we all go into this school year. Please pray for safe travels as we head to our safari in the morning. We are looking forward to sweet time together this weekend as we close out our journey in Zambia!</p>
