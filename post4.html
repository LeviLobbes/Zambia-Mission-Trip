                <p>Sunday morning brought with it a beautiful sunrise across the hills, signaling the start of a good day despite the cooler weather. After getting a quick breakfast, we headed over to the church for all students and staff of the Tree of Life facility where we joined our African friends for their service. We were quickly energized by their lively spirit and dancing, and it was heart-warming to hear the small children sing praises to the Lord in their own languages. The pastor then delivered a wonderful message about the story of Daniel and the hardships he went through for us to hear. The whole experience reminded me of Revelation 7:9 that talks about a great multitude made up of all nations and tongues gathered before God together.</p>
                <p>After that wonderful sermon, we took the bus to lunch at 3 Trees Cafe for a delicious meal. We also met up again with Leighton and her six month old Noah who became the star of the show. When we had finished our lunch, we hopped back on the bus and headed straight for the market. On the way, some hawkers—or street salesmen—crowded around the windows of the bus trying their very best to catch our attention with anything from small trinkets to even puppies! This was a perfect invitation to the market we stopped at just minutes later. The sight of twenty students wandering a local market, bartering with locals in Kwacha (the local currency) was certainly a sight to behold. From wooden figurines to locally made clothes to neatly crafted bags, there was something for everyone. With souvenirs in hand, we wandered back to the bus and squeezed in as best we could. We returned with filled bags, emptied pockets, and yet another unforgettable experience.</p>
