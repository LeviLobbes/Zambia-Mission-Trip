                <p>The day started with our beautiful Zambian sunrise. I actually got to wake up at 5 am and watch the sky change colors and take some time to thank the Lord for the wondrous work He has done this last week. We had our traditional breakfast and headed off to meet our students again at the Legacy Center. Most of us girls got to wear our Chidenye skirts we purchased at the market a couple days prior. The change between day 1 and day 2 was like night and day. The students were a lot more comfortable with the material and were eager and excited to continue learning about resumes and practice their interviews. I got to lead out in teaching a Sic Em, which the students greatly enjoyed, and we got to continue building incredible friendships with the students. Me and my table partner, Winston, had a loud and enthusiastic table of students who loved dancing and cheered so so loud when someone at the table answered the question. It wasn’t long before our entire table became best friends. We were taught many words in Nyanja, their tribal language. Some of our favorites included Mzanga, meaning friend, and lots and lots of Nikukonda maningi, or I love you very very much. We introduced the students to “cultural” Texas dances like Footloose and enjoyed Mexican candy brought by Mariana. Before the students left for the day, we were able to pray for them as they prepared for the job fair on Friday, and encourage them and tell them just how proud we were of them and of all the work they had accomplished these past two days. Once the buses took off,  we raced back to the lodge to get ready to visit Charl, the husband of a Baylor alum who has created the most incredible business in Zambia. We got to walk around his amazing Real Estate factory as well as listen to one of the most inspiring presentations I have ever heard of in my whole life. He spoke about what fatherhood meant to him, the different cultural challenges in Africa, the beauty of the state of Texas, and so much more. We all left feeling extremely motivated and grateful to have had the opportunity to meet him. He then invited us back to his home in “the jungle” as comically described by his son back when we met them earlier in the airport. His beautiful wife Cara greeted us with delicious stone oven pizza, and we enjoyed fellowship and much needed American food for the rest of the night. It was a beautiful Zambian night filled with a constant reminder of how love and compassion can extend beyond cultural barriers. The bus ride home was a frenzy of the Hamilton soundtrack, Let it go sang in Japanese, and some pretty serious speed bumps that had some of us flying. All in all, we are having the absolute time of our lives in Zambia. I am forever greatful to be surrounded by both Baylor and Zambian students alike, and I can’t wait to spend another amazing week here.</p>
