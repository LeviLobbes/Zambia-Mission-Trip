                <p>Our trip wraps up as we head on the last leg of our journey— the travel home. During the many hours of waiting in a bus, airport, or airplane seat, we all reflect on how much we experienced on this trip. I cannot believe that we made it to this point; everything has been flying by so fast with our busy schedules. It seems like just yesterday that we first set off to Africa, not knowing what to expect or even each other’s names. Yet, at the same time, we experienced so many adventures, challenges, and blessings that it seems we have been in Africa for a lifetime. We had incredible opportunities to be a light and encouragement to the children and students at Family Legacy and to learn from them even as they learned from us. We also were able to explore a new part of the world very far away from home and come to know a different culture just as full of energy. In addition, we were able to function as a tight knit team, helping and leading each other to act as one body of believers. Through all these things, we grew as individuals and better learned what it means to follow Christ in all aspects of life.</p>
                <p>On behalf of our whole team, I want to thank everyone who donated and prayed for our trip. It would not have been possible without you. We really saw the Lord answer the many prayers surrounding our trip and bless it abundantly in our travels, our relations with the students, and our relations with each other. We have all seen Ephesians 3:20 come to life as the Lord as done immeasurably more than all we could have asked or imagined. As we leave this trip, we all do so with a memory full of wonderful times and incredible experiences, for which we will always be thankful.</p>
