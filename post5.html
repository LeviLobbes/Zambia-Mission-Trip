                <p>This morning started bright and early with our first Workshop day! After breakfast we headed over to the Legacy Center to set up and prepare for the day with the Excel Beyond students. These are students who have either just completed or are in the process of completing their post-secondary schooling, with majors spanning from sciences and technology, to hospitality and fashion design. We were each split into ten groups by major, with two Baylor students and up to nine Excel Beyond students per group, these are the groups that we got the opportunity to work with closely today.</p>
                <p>Our sessions today covered the DISC personality assessment, creating a resume, interviewing, and professional communication. We focused on practicing one-on-one mock interviews as well as resume revising, in order to prepare the students for the career fair that will end out the week, where they will get the opportunity to interview with Zambian companies, to hopefully walk away from the week with a potential job offer. We then shared a meal with the students, where they introduced to us some of the staple cultural foods that they eat in Zambia, such as Nshima. We all laughed together as the students teased us about our unfamiliarity with the foods.</p>
                <p>After the workshop, we changed from our professional dress, into something a little more athletic, as we headed down the hill to the Tree of Life Village, which houses around 450 children in the Family Legacy program. We played futbol, basketball, volleyball, and gaga ball, activities that know no language barriers. The kids were so fun to be around as we saw their contagious joy and ruthless athletic abilities (they absolutely did not take it easy on us). It was hard to leave as we all had to get to dinner, but we promised that we would be back later in the week, which is something for our group to greatly look forward to.</p>
                <p>We ended the night with dinner, a beautiful sunset, and our nightly devotionals as a group. Forever in awe of the skills and determination that both the Excel Beyond student and the children at the Tree of Life have, they have taught us more and more every day about how we see the world around us, as well as our own lives.</p>
