            <div class="post-detail-content">
                <p>Today was day 2 of workshop for our second group of students and the last day of workshop before our Career Fair tomorrow! The students were tasked with creating their own business plans and presenting them as a final project to conclude their learning for the week. From creating restaurants to solar electricity companies to heated clothing, these students put their heads together to come up with amazing ideas that they believe would improve their community. The future is very bright for these students and for Lusaka!</p>
                <p>Additionally, we have spent great amounts of time teaching our students about their unique, God-given personalities and their many skills and attributes. It has been truly incredible to experience them learning who they are in the eyes of their Father and gain confidence in who they are created to be. We are eager to see how this translates into their future careers!</p>
                <p>On a more personal note, today was such a meaningful day for me (Ashlyn). I’ve had the privilege of working with five amazing girls - Hellen, Ellen, Judy, Mary, and Leah - and I genuinely adore them. I feel like God has given me His heart for them. It’s been a joy to teach business skills, but the greatest privilege has been speaking truth over them and helping them grasp the beauty of their identity in Christ. Their joy is contagious, and they’ve blessed me more than I can say.</p>
                <p>Another huge win today: every single student left with a printed CV in hand. That may seem small, but access to that kind of resource is often a major barrier here. Now, they’re walking into tomorrow’s Career Fair confident and prepared. We’re so proud of them.</p>
                <p>And while so much of our time has been focused on investing in these students, one of the most unexpected blessings has been how much God is also working in us. In tonight’s Bible study, we reflected on purpose- what it means to live out our calling in Christ, not just in career but in every part of life. God is expanding our perspective, deepening our faith, and inviting us into something much bigger than ourselves.</p>
                <p>We’re expectant for all God is going to do tomorrow- and beyond.</p>
