                <p>Our day started off with a breakfast business meeting with some of Zambia’s business professionals. We learned about how to better communicate and serve the students that we will be working alongside with the trip. Our team got a close look at what it takes to get a job in Zambia. After learning from these business professionals we traveled to the Legacy Lodge where we will be staying, teaching, and investing in the students. Later in the day we toured the Life Circle facilities and got the honor of meeting the children that come from difficult backgrounds that are cared for by house mothers in their homes. Despite these challenges they showed extreme amounts of joy the entire time we were around them. The campus provides food and furniture which all the students have a hands on job in making. We wrapped up the day by fine tuning our presentations that we will be sharing with the students and saw the beautiful African sunset accompanied by an amazing dinner.</p>
