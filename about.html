        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <div class="legacy">
            <p>Join the Baylor Business department on our mission trip to Zambia, partnering with Family Legacy. Young Zambians completing their education often face a job market with nearly 45% unemployment and little guidance. As many are the sole supporters of their families, our work helps them prepare for careers, creating brighter futures for themselves and their communities. Baylor students facilitate workshops on sales, customer service, interviewing, business plan writing, business ethics, and presentation skills. On the final day, we host a career fair, guiding Zambian students through interviews, aiming for immediate employment opportunities.</p>
